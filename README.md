# serovar_detector
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae causes severe respiratory illness in production pigs and piglets. One major task in the prohobition of spread as well as treatment, is to identify the composition of capsule genes. These capsule genes can in combination be used too provide servariant typing of A. pleuropneumoniae.

This Pipeline provides a pipeline for detecting capsule genes and dessiminate serovar from combination of present genes.
